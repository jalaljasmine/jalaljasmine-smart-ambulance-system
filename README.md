# 🚑 Smart Ambulance Routing & Traffic Optimization System

An AI-powered Smart City project that helps emergency services recommend the best hospital and the fastest ambulance route by combining Machine Learning, Traffic Prediction, Hospital Recommendation, and Route Optimization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

During a road accident, every minute is critical. This project predicts accident severity, recommends a suitable hospital, estimates traffic conditions, and finds the shortest route for the ambulance using Dijkstra's algorithm.

The system is designed to reduce ambulance response time and support better emergency decision-making.

## 📊 Machine Learning Models

### Accident Severity Model

Predicts:

- Slight Injury
- Serious Injury
- Fatal Injury

---

### Traffic Prediction Model

Predicts traffic congestion using historical traffic data.

---

## 🏥 Hospital Recommendation

Hospitals are ranked using:

- ICU Beds
- Trauma Center Availability
- Emergency Staff
- Accident Severity

The hospital with the highest score is recommended.

---

## 🛣 Route Optimization

Uses:

- OpenStreetMap
- OSMnx
- NetworkX
- Dijkstra Algorithm

Outputs:

- Shortest Route
- Distance
- Estimated Travel Time

---

## ▶️ Run the Project

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 📌 Current Output

```
Predicted Severity : Serious Injury

Predicted Traffic : 9.82

Recommended Hospital :
Government General Hospital

Distance : 3.25 km

Estimated Time : 4.88 minutes
```
